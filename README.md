## About
This project is to practice HTML and CSS, using flex to make a landing page.
It was made during the foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Content
I took advantage of this proyect to make my own web page for the presentation of my professional services, some content, and contact info.
I am currently not using this brand or line of work too much but it is good to do a project with real info/data. (even if it took and extra day of hard work).
